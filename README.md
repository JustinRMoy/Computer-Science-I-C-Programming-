# Computer-Science-I-C-Programming-
These files contain the C programming assignments I did for Computer Science 1 at UCF.

Assignmet 1 will take in an "infex" which is just a striong of math equations (ex: (7-3)/(2+2)) and convert it to its postfix equivalence (ex: 73-22+/). The code will then evaluate the expression and give you the correct calculation. Further details can be found in the "Midter Assignment-1" pdf.

Assignment 2 gives you a total number of people. Using a doubly linked-list I had to print out the number of people in reverse order, then rearange the structure so that will print out in ascending order. NOTE: the Linked-List was required to be reversed; we were not allowed to just print the order and skip rearanging the List. We are given a number k that will determine which kth person would be removed from the list and would keep removing every kth person ubtil there was only 1 person left. Further details can be found in the "Midter Assignment-2" pdf.

Final Assignment 1: we are given a circle on an xy-plae, the center, radius, and the total number of coordinates on the plane. We must determine which coordinates are outside the circle, remove them and print them out on a txt file. Aftwards we must ask the user to enter a coordinate and search the records of the coordinates that were printed out if they exist and indicate which row they are in, in the file.

Final Assignment 2: I created a basic binary search tree from reading a list of word from the file, and create a search and delete function for the tree. I also had to create a function that could decide whether the tree was balanced or not.
