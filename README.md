# Computer-Science-I-C-Programming-
These files contain the C programming assignments I did for Computer Science 1 at UCF.
Assignmet 1 will take in an "infex" which is just a striong of math equations (ex: (7-3)/(2+2)) and convert it to its postfix equivalence (ex: 73-22+/). The code will then evaluate the expression and give you the correct calculation. Further details can be found in the "Midter Assignment-1" pdf.
